Setup:
* shuffle the deck and deal each player 5 cards.
* Choose the proper divider for the number of players and place the divider on top of the spinner[reference picture]. Each player gets their own segment of the spinner. (add divider picture, and show diagram with each player number and spinner)
* Spin the board. Whichever player has the red marker in their zone goes first

Turns:
* draw a card.
* play one card on any slot in your zone. Cards can only be played on black slots or stacks that match the color of the card. 
* Follow any instructions on the card, then rotate the board the amount of clicks in the direction specified by the card. 
* The next player clockwise then starts their turn (card rules nonwithstanding).

Lockdown phase:
The lockdown phase can be triggered by:
* The number of lockdowns on the board is equal to the number of players
* The deck is empty
* A player is not able to play a card

* Every player, except for the one that caused the game to end gets a final turn, where the board does not spin. 
* The player with the most victory points on top of the stacks in their zone at the end of the game[show diagram of card].



Addendum:

Lockdown: If victory points are tied, then total up all victory points in all stacks, instead of just the top.
For this tiebreak, negative/multipliers apply to whole stacks when calculating totals

Other things to add:
- Anatomy of a card
- Weird situations that come up. 
- If a card has you redraw your hand, redraw 5 cards.



Todo: clarify target
what you're playing vs anywhere on the board
rd vs turn (inclusive/exclusive)
Lockdown removal?
Make lockdown not have movement
Change shape

design a straigtforward path to victory
blank cards?
