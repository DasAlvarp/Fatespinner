Setup:
At the start of the game, shuffle the deck and deal each player 5 cards. Choose the proper divider. Place the divider on top of the spinner[reference picture]. Each player gets their own segment of the spinner. (add divider picture, and show diagram with each player number and spinner)

Turns:
At the start of your turn, draw a card. You can play one card on any tower in your zone. Cards can only be played on top of blank towers or towers with a lower cost than the card being played. Follow any instructions on the card, then rotate the board the amount of clicks in the direction specified. The next player clockwise then starts their turn.

The end of the game:
When the game ends, whether it's the second lockdown, the deck is emptied, or a player being unable to play in their zone, the board is "locked down." Every player, except for the one that caused the game to end gets another turn. The player with the most victory points in their zone at the end of the game[show diagram of card]
